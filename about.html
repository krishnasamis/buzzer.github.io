      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <p>
     <ul>
<li> In our combined past we've been public school teachers, corporate trainers,school-of-rock owners, learning strategists to Fortune 100 companies, coaches, creators of the world's foremost social learning software, keynote speakers, bloggers, and Sunday school teachers.</li><br>

<li>We created BUZZER because although there are many quiz tools out there, none of them are awesome. We wanted to bring our bag of tricks to a space that has been filled with mediocre tools and create something really special.</li><br>

<li>By creating the world's simplest, most beautiful and mobile-friendly quiz creation tool, we aim to create the world's largest collection of quizzes on any topic accessible to anyone for free.</li><br>

<li>We like to think we're powering the quiz revolution. Qwizards unite.</li></ul>
